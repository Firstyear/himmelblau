# Himmelblau

Himmelblau is an interoperability suite for Microsoft Azure AD and Intune.

The name of the project comes from a German word for Azure (sky blue).

Himmelblau supports Linux authentication to Microsoft Azure AD (AAD) via PAM and NSS modules.
The PAM and NSS modules communicate with AAD via the himmelblaud daemon.
