.SH NAME
himmelblaud_tasks \- Home directory creation daemon for Himmelblau
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B himmelblaud_tasks
.SH DESCRIPTION
The `himmelblaud_tasks` daemon is responsible for automatically creating home directories for users upon successful authentication via Azure Entra ID. This service is required to run as the root user, as it needs elevated permissions to create directories in system locations.

The daemon operates as a background service and does not accept any command-line arguments. It is automatically invoked by the system when required.

.SH USAGE
The `himmelblaud_tasks` daemon must be run as the root user. If the daemon is started without root privileges, it will fail with an error. No user interaction is needed beyond ensuring the daemon is active and running correctly.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B Start the daemon:
# systemctl start himmelblaud_tasks

.TP
.B Verify the status of the daemon:
# systemctl status himmelblaud_tasks

.SH NOTES
This daemon is integral to Himmelblau for handling user home directory creation. It ensures that users can properly log in with a valid directory structure in place after authentication.
